How to build MultiTouch
----------------------------------

This project is in its infancy. Things are still a bit difficult. 
I checked out a clean repository and this is what I had to do. I
am running Ubuntu 11.10 64bit.

Things will get better as I add more hours to the project!


1) Qt 4.7.3 and QtCreator - I installed the Ubuntu 11.10 packages via apt-get install.

2) OpenCV 2.3.1(a) - This was the biggest pain to build and install. I did it from source
   including its dependencies such as FFMPEG. I followed the instructions 
   http://ozbots.org/opencv-installation/  with a few minor tweeks which I do not recall.

3) QJson - JSON parser. Messages in the gaming portions of the code are sent UDP as json 
   packages. The code is located in contrib/qjson

   cd contrib/qjson
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ../
   make
   
   navigate to the build/lib folder and copy libqjson.so and all its simlinks to the linux
   folder. 


4) libtiled - Used to parse the maps in gameplay. Source is located in contrib/tiled. This 
   is a little older and I need to update it to latest release. This comes from 
   http://mapeditor.org. I use QtCreator to build this. Navigate to folder contrib/tiled/src 
   and open tiled.pro with QtCreator. Build the project. Go to the location that you built to 
   and copy libtiled.so and all its symlinks to the ROOT/linux folder.


5) Building the project. Open ROOT/multitable.pro  in QtCreator and build.



Gotachs
--------------------
1) Turn of shadow builds (for now) else the linker cannot find the libraries. In QtCreator in 
   the multitable.pro project select Projects and on the Build Settings tab under General turn
   off Shadow build

2) One path is still hard coded in the source. You need to change it according to your directory 
   structure. This will be removed soon. In the file:
      ROOT/src/libmtdnd/utils/FileUtils.cpp in the function binDirectory(). This function should
      return the fully qualified path to ROOT/linux



Thats it for now.
