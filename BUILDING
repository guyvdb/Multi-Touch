How to build MultiTouch
----------------------------------

This project is in its infancy. Things are still a bit difficult. 
I checked out a clean repository and this is what I had to do. I
am running Ubuntu 11.10 64bit.

Things will get better as I add more hours to the project!


1) Qt 4.7.3 and QtCreator - I installed the Ubuntu 11.10 packages via apt-get install.

2) OpenCV 2.3.1(a) - This was the biggest pain to build and install. I did it from source
   including its dependencies such as FFMPEG. I followed the instructions 
   http://ozbots.org/opencv-installation/  with a few minor tweeks which I do not recall.

3) QJson - JSON parser. Messages in the gaming portions of the code are sent UDP as json 
   packages. The code is located in contrib/qjson

   cd contrib/qjson
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ../
   make
   
   navigate to the build/lib folder and copy libqjson.so and all its simlinks to the linux
   folder. 


4) libtiled - Used to parse the maps in gameplay. Source is located in contrib/tiled. This 
   is a little older and I need to update it to latest release. This comes from 
   http://mapeditor.org. I use QtCreator to build this. Navigate to folder contrib/tiled/src 
   and open tiled.pro with QtCreator. Build the project. Go to the location that you built to 
   and copy libtiled.so and all its symlinks to the ROOT/linux folder.


5) Building the project. Open ROOT/multitable.pro  in QtCreator and build. When you open the
   project for the first time it will want to set shadow build paths for both debug and release.
   Set them both to ROOT/build



Gotachs
--------------------
1) Set your shadow build directory to ROOT/build for both debug and release builds
2) In QtCreator under projects on the Run Settings tab for each Run configuration modify 
   the run environment. Add a variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH = ../bin




Thats it for now.


Cheers
