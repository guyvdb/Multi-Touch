  *.form files are actually just HTML 5 markup with custom elements.

  You can embedd or link items relative to the location of the file.

  The custom elements are:


  field
  -------------------------------
  field is an element that outputs a data field from the character.
  The type of field and available options are calculated by libchar.
  The only thing you have to tell it is the field name in the name
  attribute. Optionally, you can add a css class with the class
  attribute that will be honered by the system.

  The output will expand as follows:

  given:
      <div class="xyz" name="Level"/>


  simple field:
      <field class="xyz" name="Level">
      </field>

      Fake button so all data fields loose focus. Their onChange events
      will fire if they have changed and they will be saved
   -->
