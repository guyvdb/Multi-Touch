== Game System Description Language (GDSL)
===============================================================================

GDSL is an internal domain specific language (DSL) targeting the Role 
Playing Game domain. This is a short introduction to GDSL.

The language is untyped (for now). All variable data is entered as 
double quoted strings. All unquoted strings are keywords.

GDSL is container orientated. Almost everything goes inside a container.
A container is denoted by curly brackets {}. Single statements are line 
orientated. I.e. the statement is terminated at the end of the line indicated
as EOL in the text.

Keywords are case sensitive and are always lower case. Following is a 
description of each keyword. The paragraph starts with the formal usage
of the keyword followed by a brief description.


system <value> {}
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
system is the outermost conatiner. It is the first item in the file. The 
parameter <value> is a quoted string used for descriptive purposed. The
allowable items inside the system container are:
  * source        (0..n)
  * character     (1)
  * table         (0..n)

example: system "D&D 4e" {}



source <value> EOL
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
source is a line oriented item. The parameter value is a descriptive value of
some source material.
