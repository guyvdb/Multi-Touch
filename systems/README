== Game System Description Language (GDSL)
===============================================================================

GDSL is an internal domain specific language (DSL) targeting the Role 
Playing Game domain. This is a short introduction to GDSL.

The language is untyped (for now). All variable data is entered as 
double quoted strings. All unquoted strings are keywords.

GDSL is container orientated. Almost everything goes inside a container.
A container is denoted by curly brackets {}. Single statements are line 
orientated. I.e. the statement is terminated at the end of the line indicated
as EOL in the text.

Keywords are case sensitive and are always lower case. Following is a 
description of each keyword. The paragraph starts with the formal usage
of the keyword followed by a brief description and an example.


system <value> {}
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
system is the outermost conatiner. It is the first item in the file. The 
parameter <value> is a quoted string used for descriptive purposed. The
allowable items inside the system container are:
  * source        (0..n)
  * character     (1)
  * table         (0..n)

The items in the container must follow this order. You cannot place table above
source or character below table, etc.

example: system "D&D 4e" {}



source <value> EOL
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
source is a line oriented item. The parameter value is a descriptive value of
some source material.

example: source "Players Handbook" EOL



character {}
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
character is a container indicated the start of character definition. The 
allowable items inside the character container are:
  * group       (0..n)

example: character {}


group <value> {}
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
group is a container used to group data fields in a logical manner. The parameter 
value is a descriptive, unique name of the group. You are not allowed to create 
two groups with the same name. The name of the group is used during various data
field create methods and is indicated therein.

The allowable items inside the group container are:
   * field      (0..n)
   * lookup     (0..n)
   * half       (0..n)
   * modifier   (0..n)
   * add        (0..n)

The order of the items in this container do not matter. You can place these
items in any order that you would like. Any data fields that are created
(through field, lookup, half, etc) are created and stored in the order you
specify.

example: group "Ability" {}


field <value> EOL
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
field is a line orientated item. It is used to create a non-computed,
non-lookup data field. The parameter value is the name of the field. Other
keywords (macros) can use the name of this field in their computations.

example: field "Speed"


lookup <value> EOL
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
lookup is a line orientated item. It is used to create a field whos value will
be looked up out of a table. The parameter value is both the name of this field
and the name of the table that will be used to lookup allowable values for this
field.


example: lookup "Race"
